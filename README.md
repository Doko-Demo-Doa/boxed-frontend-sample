# Boxed sample

Things used to make this:

- [Mantine UI Kit](https://mantine.dev/)
- [react-query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (no, I don't use CRA since it's slow)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/) in conjunction with Vite

There are some notable packages:

- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#typescript-usage): I did not actually use this, but for the sake of "State management",
  I decided to install it anyway for later use if needed.
